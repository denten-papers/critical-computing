## Intro

It is tempting to think that students in the liberal arts require a watered
down version of computer science fundamentals to remain interested in the
subject. Unlike engineering majors, they are not usually on a career track to
join the software industry. For this reason, the motivation for mastering a
rigorous curriculum in computational literacy must come from other sources.
Yet, in creating a shallow version of the curriculum, we risk alienating the
very audience that could most benefit from a deep engagement with their
everyday computational environment. In this paper, we will outline an approach
to teaching CS foundations in way that does diminish the material. Instead, we
articulate a set of principles that connect key ideas in computer science and
software engineering to values intrinsic to humanistic inquiry. We refer to
this approach as "critical computing." And rather than discuss a specific
curriculum, our concern will be with finding natrual and mutually-enriching
points of intersection between the two cultures.
